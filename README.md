1. [LINK TO THE INTERACTIVE WEB MAP](https://cheetah90.github.io/gps_failure/) This web map visualizes each incident with its approximate location and codes. The map is made for demo purposes so it only contains partial dataset. For full coding results, please refer to the coding_result.xls. The source code is contained in **interactive_map_gps_incidents.html**

2. **coding_results.tsv** contains the complete coding results. Due to copy right issues, we can't include the full text of 
each news articles. However, we included the title and publication agency in the spreadsheet, which is usually enough for searching.

3. **Search_string_development.pdf** provides step-by-step walk through of how we developed, 
refined and validated the search string that is used to search the news database

4. **Phase_2_codebook.pdf** contains the codebook developed by the domain experts that is used to code the news stories.
